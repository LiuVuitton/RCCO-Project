# Robust Control and Convex Optimization Project
## Project overview
This was my final report submission for the project graded course "Robust Control and Convex Optimization" at ETH Zurich. 

The project involved the robust control of a non trivially coupled MIMO linear system. Furthermore, the system had to be physically motivated
## Notes on report quality
I would like to preface the report with the fact that at the time, both during the midterm and the final, I had numerous other committments. As a result, there are actually many parts that could be improved, such as the part where I analyse the uncertainties and give them a physical motivation, and many more. 

At the end I got a final grade of 5.5 / 6. This score does not include an additional 0.25 points that could have been obtained by doing 7 of the 9 weekly homeworks, but because I was busy I didn't do them.

## Project requirements
- Description of the system and why it is important.
- Extensive literature review on how the system has been previously modelled and controlled.
- Derivation of the system.
- A nominal control policy that can regulate the system.
- Simulation of the closed loop system using the nominal control policy.
- Description of the sources of the uncertainties affecting the system.
- Formulation of the system dynamics with 2-5 uncertainties.
- Implementation of the Structured Singular Value (SSV) minimizing controller.
- Quantification and certification of robust performance for SSV controller.
- Comparison of SSV and nominal control policies with respect to closed loop trajectory simulations and robust performance metrics.
- Comparison of performance on experimental system operation.

## Source code and discussion
To uphold academic integrity, I will not be sharing the MATLAB and Simulink code for this project.

However, I am available to provide explainations and discuss about my methodologies and results.

If you are a student looking to take this course, I can also share my opinion about it in private.
